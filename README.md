## Clownfish Movement
A manuscript in progress by Michelle.

## Data
[nogenid.rds](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/data/nogenid.rds) - data from Katrina flagging samples that appear in sequencing data but don't have a gen_id.  
[nogenid_seq03-33.rds](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/data/nogenid_seq03-33.rds)  
[recaptured-fish.Rdata](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/data/recaptured-fish.Rdata) - a table of recaptured fish including a recap_id to connect gen_id and tag_id recaptured fish, generated based on data we had as of March 12, 2018.  
[seq03-33_identity](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/tree/master/data/seq03-33_identity) - a folder containing files used for the cervus identity analysis.

## Plots
[plot-clownfish-at-size-change-M-to-F.md](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/plots/plot-clownfish-at-size-change-from-M-to-F.md) - graphic output version of the code to produce plots.  
[plot-clownfish-at-size-change-M-to-F.Rmd](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/plots/plot-clownfish-at-size-change-from-M-to-F.Rmd) - notebook to produce size distrubtion plots.  
[plot-clownfish-at-size-change-M-to-F_figures](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/tree/master/plots/plot-clownfish-at-size-change-from-M-to-F_files/figure-markdown_github) - folder holding png images of the size distribution plots.  
[where_caught.pdf](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/plots/where_caught.pdf) - a pdf of a plot of the number of fish captured on the same anemone or different anemones from the original capture.

## Scripts
Tons and tons of scripts to do analysis on genomic data.
